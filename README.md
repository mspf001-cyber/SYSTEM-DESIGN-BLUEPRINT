## Introduction to System Design

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It's a crucial skill for software engineers, as it involves making high-level design choices that can have a significant impact on the performance, scalability, and reliability of an application. 

The blueprint below illustrates a modern, distributed system architecture that is commonly used for building large-scale web applications.

## The Lifecycle of a Request: An Overview

Before we dive into the individual components, let's take a high-level look at how a user's request flows through the system:

1. **DNS Resolution**: The user enters a domain name (e.g., www.example.com) into their browser. The browser contacts a DNS server to resolve this domain name into an IP address.
2. **Load Balancer**: The request is sent to the IP address of the load balancer. The load balancer's job is to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes a bottleneck.
3. **API Gateway**: The request then hits the API Gateway, which acts as a single entry point for all client requests. It can handle tasks like authentication, rate limiting, and routing requests to the appropriate backend service.
4. **Backend Servers**: The API Gateway forwards the request to one of the backend servers. These servers contain the core business logic of the application.
5. **Data Layer (Database, Cache, Object Storage)**: The backend server may need to read or write data to fulfill the request. It will interact with the database, cache, and object storage as needed.
6. **Asynchronous Operations (Message Queue)**: For long-running or non-critical tasks, the backend server can push a message to a message queue. This allows the server to respond to the user quickly while the task is processed asynchronously by other services.
7. **Response**: The backend server sends a response back to the API Gateway, which in turn sends it back to the user's browser.

## Core Components

### DNS (Domain Name System)

- **Definition**: The DNS is the phonebook of the Internet. It translates human-readable domain names (like www.google.com) into machine-readable IP addresses (like 172.217.168.68).
- **How it works**: When you type a domain name into your browser, your computer sends a request to a DNS resolver. The resolver then queries a series of DNS servers to find the corresponding IP address.

### Load Balancing

- **Definition**: Load balancing is the process of distributing network traffic across multiple servers. This ensures that no single server bears too much of the load, which improves responsiveness and availability.

- **Types of Load Balancers**:
  - **Layer 4 (Transport Layer)**: Makes routing decisions based on IP addresses and ports.
  - **Layer 7 (Application Layer)**: Can make more intelligent routing decisions based on the content of the request (e.g., URL, cookies).

- **Common Algorithms**:
  - **Round Robin**: Distributes requests to servers in a rotating sequential manner.
  - **Least Connections**: Sends traffic to the server with the fewest active connections.
  - **IP Hash**: The IP address of the client is used to determine which server receives the request.

### API Gateway

- **Definition**: An API Gateway is a single entry point for all client requests. It acts as a reverse proxy, routing requests from clients to the appropriate backend services.
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - **Authentication and Authorization**: Verifying the identity of the user and ensuring they have permission to access the requested resource.
  - **Rate Limiting**: Protecting backend services from being overwhelmed with too many requests.
  - **Request Routing**: Directing requests to the correct microservice.
  - **SSL Termination**: Offloading the work of encrypting and decrypting HTTPS traffic from the backend servers.

### Frontend Servers & CDN

- **Frontend Servers**: These servers are responsible for delivering the user interface of the application to the client's browser. This often involves serving static assets like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
- **CDN (Content Delivery Network)**: A CDN is a network of geographically distributed servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. By caching content in locations closer to the user, a CDN can significantly reduce latency.

### Backend Servers

- **Definition**: Backend servers are where the core business logic of the application resides. They are responsible for processing user requests, interacting with the database, and performing other application-specific tasks.
  
- **Scaling**:
  - **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more servers to the pool of resources.
  - **Vertical Scaling**: Increasing the resources (CPU, RAM) of a single server.

### Database

- **Definition**: A database is an organized collection of data, generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system.
  
- **Types of Databases**:
  - **Relational (SQL)**: Data is stored in tables with a predefined schema (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
  - **Non-Relational (NoSQL)**: Data is stored in a variety of ways, such as key-value, document, or graph (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).

### Cache

- **Definition**: A cache is a high-speed data storage layer that stores a subset of data, typically transient in nature, so that future requests for that data are served up faster than is possible by accessing the data's primary storage location.

[What is Caching? - AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/caching/)

### Object Storage

- **Definition**: Object storage is a data storage architecture that manages data as objects, as opposed to file systems or block storage.

### Message Queue

- **Definition**: A message queue is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures.

## Services to Scale the System

### Distributed ID Generator

- **Definition**: A distributed ID generator creates unique IDs in a scalable and fault-tolerant way. Common approaches include UUID and Twitterâ€™s Snowflake.

### Rate Limiting

- **Definition**: Rate limiting is used to prevent server overload and to manage traffic, often using algorithms like Token Bucket or Leaky Bucket.

### Common Fan-out Services

"Fan-out" is a pattern where a single event or message triggers multiple actions or notifications, typically using a publish/subscribe (pub/sub) model with a message queue.

#### Notification Service

Sends notifications to users via various channels (email, SMS, etc.).

#### Recommendation Engine

Suggests content or products to users based on behavior.

#### Analytics Service

Collects and analyzes user data for insights.

#### Payment Service

Handles payment processing, including fraud detection and transaction logging.

## Conclusion

This document provides a high-level overview of the key components of a modern system design blueprint. Each of these components is a complex topic in its own right, and there are many different ways to implement them. The best design for a particular application will depend on its specific requirements.
